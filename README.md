## User Stories:

### MVP
```
As a user
I want to be able to list a task
So that I can request help
```
```
As a user
I want to be able to see a list of tasks
So that I can help someone in need
```
### v 1.2
This second iteration differentiates two user types. Those who are volunteering, and those who are getting benefit from the volunteers' efforts (beneficiaries).

Volunteers are not able to list tasks of their own, and beneficiaries are limited to seeing only the tasks they themselves have requested help for. 
```
As a user 
I want to be able to see information on the homepage
So that I can understand the service
```
```
As a user 
I want to be able to sign up from the homepage

```
```
